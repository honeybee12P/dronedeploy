Description :

This is the assignment given to me as first round during my drone deploy internship interview.

Assignment Question:

This zip file https://www.dropbox.com/s/afrfye7hvra7wvy/images.zip?dl=0 contains a number of images taken from different positions and orientations with an iPhone 6. Each image is the view of a pattern on a flat surface. The original pattern that was photographed is 8.8cm x 8.8cm and is included in the zip file. Write a Python program that will visualize (i.e. generate a graphic) where the camera was when each image was taken and how it was posed, relative to the pattern.
You can assume that the pattern is at 0,0,0 in some global coordinate system and are thus looking for the x, y, z and yaw, pitch, roll of the camera that took each image.

How to run ?

1.	Go to your terminal
2.	Navigate to the dronedeploy folder
3.	run using "python dronedeploy.py"

Results :

The pictures with camera drawn can be found at images folder as img1_camerapose.png, img2_camerapose.png, img3_camerapose.png, img4_camerapose.png, img5_camerapose.png, img6_camerapose.png, img7_camerapose.png, img8_camerapose.png, img9_camerapose.png
